## Implementation

This section aims to describe the implementation of the features in UniCa$h.

There are 4 main group of features that we have design and either implemented
or propose to implement in the future.

These are:
1. Transaction Management
2. Budget Management and Monitoring
3. General Utility Features
4. User Interface Auxiliary Features

### Transaction

<img src="images/unicash/TransactionClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

UniCa$h tracks transactions with the use of `TransactionList` and `Transaction`. `TransactionList` acts
as a wrapper for a list of `Transaction` that enforces no `null`.

The `Transaction` class is composed of the following fields

1. `Name`: The name of the transaction.
2. `Type`: The transaction type of the transaction. UniCash supports expense and income only.
3. `Amount`: The monetary value of the transaction.
4. `DateTime`: The date and time of the transaction to be recorded.
5. `Location`: The location where the transaction took place.
6. `UniqueCategoryList`: A list of categories to be tagged with the transaction.

For the attributes, there are 3 compulsory fields, namely `Name`, `Type` and
`Amount`. The remaining fields would fall back to a default value if not specified.

#### Add Transaction

##### Overview

The `add_transaction` command adds a new `Transaction` to the `TransactionList` in UniCash.

The activity diagram of adding a Transaction is as shown below

<img src="images/unicash/AddTransactionActivityDiagram.png" width="1200" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the different components of UniCash interact with each other

<img src="images/unicash/AddTransactionSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />

The above sequence diagram omits details on the creation of the attributes of a `Transaction` such as 
`Name`, `Type` and `Amount` as it would make the diagram cluttered and difficult to read without adding
additional value.

ℹ️ **Note:** The lifeline for `AddTransactionCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

##### Details

1. The user specifies the transaction to be added by stating the name, amount, transaction type as well as any other optional fields.
2. The input will be parsed by `AddCommandTransactionParser`, and if it is invalid, `ParserException` is thrown, prompting for the user to enter again.
3. If the input is valid, a `Transaction` object is created and passed into the `AddTransactionCommand` to be executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The `LogicManager` will then invoke the execute command, adding the `Transaction` to the UniCash.

Note that only the `Category` field is allowed to be specified multiple times, while the other fields can only be specified once, else
a `ParserException` is thrown. Another noteworthy point is that `Category` that are added are to be case-insensitively unique and can only be up to 
a specified value in the `UniqueCategoryList` class. Else, a `ParserException` would be thrown.
