## Project: UniCa$h

### Project Overview

UniCa$h is a desktop application for university students who want to be more financially conscious.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. UniCa$h is designed
for users who are proficient with using the Command Line, and want effective and efficient digital
management of their finances. 

UniCa$h is written in Java 11, built with Gradle, packaged into a jar file and can be run on any
device running Java 11 or above, and it can be run locally with no network access required. 

Given below are my contributions to the project, including the features that I've implemented, the
code and documentation that I've contributed, the team tasks that I have been involved in, and 
enhancements that I've implemented or proposed to implement for UniCa$h.
